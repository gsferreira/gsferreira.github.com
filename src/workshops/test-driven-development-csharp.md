# _"Test-Driven Development changed the way I write code."_

Have you been around Test-Driven Development (TDD) practitioners? So, you have heard this before.

They like to brag about TDD benefits such as:

- fewer bugs
- productivity gains
- code easier to maintain
- stress-free developer life
- abnormal level of confidence in code

I know it sounds too good to be true. But, **few practices have the label "Transformational" used as often as TDD**.

But let's talk about the question that's on your mind: If TDD is so good, why is it not widely adopted?

**Although TDD is a simple concept, it is hard to master.**

But don't worry about that. This Workshop will take you there.

**At the end of this Workshop you will be able to:**

- Understand the steps involved during a TDD session.
- Drive the development using automated tests.
- Test-drive code with External Dependencies.
- Use refactoring techniques to improve code safely.
- Write long-lasting tests resilient to changes.
- Be successful with TDD in the context of a Team.
- Confidently evolve and maintain legacy applications using TDD.

All using C# and your favourite tools.

I risk saying that at the end of this, you might become test-addicted.

### Is this Workshop for you?

Do you want to improve your tests and code?
If so, this Workshop is for you.

If you have built C# .NET applications and have written unit tests in the past, you know all that's needed.

I believe in learning through experience. So, you can expect two days of hands-on and collaboration moments. Warning: This is not a lecture-type workshop, so come ready to participate actively.

### What will you need?

I'm a strong believer you should learn using your favourite day-to-day tools. So, in this Workshop, you only need:

- Your favourite IDE (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, VS Code)
- .NET 8
- Docker (no need for Kubernetes)
- Git
- GitHub.com Account
