    <p><strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong>: This text contains <strong>opinions</strong> from the author about smartphones.</p>

<h2>Confession</h2>

<p>I'm a huge fan of Windows Phone since the early days and I have been using it since 2011. 
I followed the growing and I struggled with all the limitations in past years.</p>

<p>Until the last month I'd never used an Android Phone or an iPhone as my personal phones. 
I've been playing with them in work or with family phones, and I have to honestly say that I never fall in love for them. 
But I need to refer that I'm not a hater of them, I respect both Operating Systems.</p>

<p>I can see their pros and cons and I try to stay away from those fanboy discussions <em>(usually I'm the guy that they will make fun because for my friends I'm the only person in the country with a Windows Phone)</em>.  </p>

<p><img src="/images/are-you-sure-that-android-is-better-than-windows-phone-fun.jpg" alt="fun" /></p>

<p>In the last month, I noticed that the camera button of my Nokia Lumia was a little loose and I decided that was time to send it to repair. 
I needed a substitution phone and I decided to give a try to Android because <strong>I'm a kind of disappointed with the Nokia hardware quality</strong> and I was really <strong>curious to try a different operating system</strong>. 
I've faced the experience with an open heart and really expecting to be surprised.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>I managed to get a Vodafone Prime 6, it's not a flagship product but it's a cool phone and I used it during a month.
Here I will explain <strong>what I loved in Android and what I missed from my Windows Phone</strong>.</p>

<p>*I want to point out that I won't compare hardware features.  *</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<hr />

<h2>What I loved</h2>

<p><strong>1. Meterial Design</strong></p>

<p>I love minimalist design and all the flat design stuff. I really like the work done by google. All the simplicity, the amazing use of the depth and animations made me like Material Design.</p>

<p><strong>2. Apps... Tons of Apps...</strong></p>

<p>If you ask an Android fan how to do something he will reply to you "There's an App to do that!". This is a great resume of the main advantage of the platform comparing to Windows Phone.
I don't say that I like to 500 versions of angry birds or another useless apps in the Play Store, but I appreciate have the official version of some apps that I use every day like Trello, Pocket or Buffer.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What I really don't like</h2>

<p><strong>1. User Experience</strong></p>

<p>As I said before, I'm a huge fan of Material Design and I think that he can be an important tool to improve the <strong>experience</strong>, but design isn't everything.
The applications have a lack of rules and patterns, even in the most popular apps.</p>

<p>For more than once I had to think <strong>"Where should I touch?"</strong> or <strong>"What should I do?"</strong> and those should be prohibited questions for a phone user.</p>

<p>Example: The following example shows three different cases where the main action button is in different places.</p>

<p><img src="/images/are-you-sure-that-android-is-better-than-windows-phone-ux.png" alt="Compair UX" /></p>

<p><strong>2. Opening notifications</strong></p>

<p>Push notifications are amazing and I can't live without them anymore but in Android I got a little confused.</p>

<p>The most annoying thing in Android notification system is open a notification... double touch doesn't seems natural, at least for me.    </p>

<p><strong>3. Performance</strong></p>

<p>I installed more a less 8 applications, all them popular (Trello, Sunrise, Pocket, Feedly...) and the phone is constantly blocking.
The system simply doesn't react in a fashion time. 
When a user touch to go to the main screen and nothing happens during 1 or 2 seconds the expirience is ruined.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I know that my Android phone isn't a powerfull machine, so I'm <a href="http://smartphones.specout.com/compare/968-3120/Nokia-Lumia-630-vs-Vodafone-Smart-Prime-6">comparing him with the humble Nokia Lumia 630</a>. </p>

<p><strong>4. Updates</strong></p>

<p>I simply can't get it. I'm not able to figure out the updates that are available and how can I run them. 
Sometimes I got a notification to update the app "X", another times I need to go to Play Store to do it...
The most annoying thing was one day that I saw that he was installing updates using my 3G data connection without asking for a confirmation. :O</p>

<hr />

<h2>What I missed from my Windows Phone</h2>

<p><strong>1. Tiles</strong></p>

<p>Isn't amazing to know your next appointment, see the twitter/facebook updates or read part of e-mail without a single gesture?
Windows Phone users know what I mean. Android users will probably say "There's an app to do that". :) </p>

<p><strong>2. People hub</strong></p>

<p>I really like the people hub and I missed so much the contact list navigation by the first letter.  </p>

<p><img src="/images/are-you-sure-that-android-is-better-than-windows-phone-wp-filter-contacts.png" alt="Navigation by letter" /></p>

<p><strong>3. Account management</strong></p>

<p>In android the accounts configuration is distributed and I'm a fan of that Windows Phone <strong>experience</strong> where you buy a phone, go to the Email and Accounts settings, add your accounts and your phone is ready to go.</p>

<p><strong>4. Vertical scroll at the applications list</strong></p>

<p>I'm not comfortable with the menu style of Android. Scroll horizontally between pages to get an application is not so productive as the Windows Phone vertical list.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>As I use to say, Android is a "hackable" (customizable if you prefer the word) version of IOS. With Android we can have a phone that give us <strong>freedom to do what we want</strong> and much cheaper than iPhone.</p>

<p>I <strong>won't say that Android is better or worst than Windows Phone</strong>, because they both have a role to play in this game. </p>

<p>If to you the most important thing are Apps and be able to play the new Candy Crush or Flappy Birds since the first day, I recommend you to go to Android. </p>

<p>If to you, like to me, the most important thing is the <strong>experience</strong>, so you should give a try to Windows Phone.</p>

<p>Users want apps and without apps you can't have users, but without users you will not have so many apps.  </p>

<p>In the near future, I will keep my Windows Phone. I know that there are rumors about the platform that aren't cheerful for WP users, but I really believe in the platform and I hope that Microsoft too.  </p>

<p>Feel free to leave comments.</p>
