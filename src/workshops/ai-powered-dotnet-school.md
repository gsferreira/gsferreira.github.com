# _"Deliver an AI feature in production, not a playground."_

If you've been wanting to integrate AI into your .NET applications but don't know where to start, this cohort is for you.

**This isn't about learning AI theory.** It's about shipping real AI features that users will actually use.

Over 7 weeks, you'll build a complete Budget Tracker application with:
* **AI-powered transaction categorization** - Automatically classify expenses
* **Smart description enhancement** - Let AI improve transaction descriptions
* **Intelligent CSV detection** - Parse any CSV format automatically
* **Semantic search with RAG** - Find transactions using natural language
* **Agent workflows** - Build AI agents that can use tools and make decisions
* **MCP servers** - Extend AI capabilities with custom integrations

**Why a cohort format?**

Learning AI development works best with:
* **Fixed timeline** - Stay on track with weekly milestones
* **Community support** - Learn alongside other .NET developers
* **Live feedback** - Get your questions answered in real-time
* **Practical projects** - Build something you can show in your portfolio

**By the end of this cohort you will:**
* Ship your first AI-powered feature
* Understand how to integrate LLMs into .NET applications
* Master prompt engineering and token optimization
* Implement RAG and semantic search with vector databases
* Build autonomous agents with tool-calling capabilities
* Create MCP servers to extend AI functionality
* Have a complete production-ready application in your portfolio

All using C# .NET 9, Azure OpenAI, and modern development practices.

**Is this cohort for you?**

Want to build AI features in production? Then yes, this cohort is for you.

If you've built C# .NET applications and APIs, you're ready to start. No AI or ML background needed—we'll teach you everything from scratch.

This is hands-on learning. Expect to code every week, push to GitHub, and build real features. If you prefer passive video watching, this isn't for you.

**What will you need?**

Come prepared with:
* Your favourite IDE (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
* .NET 9 SDK
* Docker (for local development)
* Git & GitHub account
* Azure account (minimal costs)
* 3-6 hours per week for lessons and practice

**Special Black Week Offer**

🎉 **Save 60% - €299** instead of €749 with code **BLACK60**

Enroll by November 30 and get:
* 7 weeks of lessons (starts January 5, 2026)
* **Bonus:** Extra month of office hours
* Complete GitHub repository
* Private developer community
* All recordings and materials
* Money-back guarantee after Week 1
