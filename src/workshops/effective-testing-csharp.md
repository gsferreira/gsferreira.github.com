# Learn the efficient way to test your C# Code

But why?

Because you hate bugs.
Because your manager hates bugs.
Because your users hate bugs.

Bugs destroy confidence, build anxiety and compromise deliveries.

But the worst of all is that, by the end, everyone will blame the developer. Blame you.

You know you need to ship code that works.

And the only tool to confidently say that code works is automated testing.

**Crossing fingers and pushing to prod** isn't a good strategy.

So, we can agree that code well tested is not optional.

There's just one problem...

Bad tests do more harm than good.

How's that possible? With bad tests:

- You waste time building useless tests.
- You have a false sense of security.
- You don't know when and where to write a test.
- You can't quickly refactor source code without throwing away tests.
- You are naturally inclined to skip tests.
- You spend too much time writing tests.

And the list could go on.

## What if trusting our applications was simple?

Great Developers know one thing: Humans aren't reliable.

That's why they don't trust humans to repetitively test code when a computer can do it.

To that, we call Automated Tests.

The weapon against bugs.

But to build those automated tests, you will need to know:

- When to test?
- What to test?
- How to write those tests?
- Which tools should you use?

And that is just the beginning.

That's why you need an efficient method. A method that not only works but also makes you more productive.

That's what you will find in this Workshop.

So, if you want to get into testing or get better at it, this Workshop will get you started.

**At the end of this Workshop you will be able to:**

- Deliver features that work as expected.
- Write readable, maintainable and trustworthy tests using C#.
- Understand the different types of testing.
- Write effective Unit Tests
- Develop Integration Tests and make sure your application works well with others.
- Be a more confident C# Developer.

All using C# and your favourite tools.

### **Is this Workshop for you?**

Do you have experience writing C#?

Are you a backend developer *(we are not covering UI Testing)*?

Do you want to write better tests without filling it's a waste of time?

If you have answered "Yes!" to those questions, this workshop is for you.

Be aware that this is not a lecture-type workshop, so come ready to engage actively. I believe in learning through experience. So, you can expect two days of hands-on and collaboration moments.

### **What will you need?**

In this Workshop, you only need:

- Your favourite IDE (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, VS Code)
- .NET 8
- Docker (no need for Kubernetes)
- Git
- GitHub.com Account
