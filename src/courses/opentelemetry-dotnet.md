# "My microservices are a black box, and I'm drowning in logs!"

Sound familiar?

I hear this from developers every day.

Your job has gotten WAY more complex. You've gone from simple apps on IIS to juggling distributed systems that span multiple services, clouds, and containers.

And yet your boss expects you to deliver more features, faster, with fewer bugs. Good luck doing that when you can't even trace a request from start to finish!

That's why you need Observability. Or, let's be specific, you need OpenTelemetry.

## What you'll learn

- Master observability fundamentals and OpenTelemetry basics
- Implement automatic and manual instrumentation in .NET
- Configure traces, metrics, and logs with practical examples
- Set up and use the OpenTelemetry Collector effectively
- Learn advanced techniques like context propagation and sampling
- Export telemetry to Jaeger, Prometheus, Loki, and OTLP

## Here's the deal with OpenTelemetry

Imagine if you could:

- See exactly how a request travels through your entire system
- Pinpoint that slow database query killing performance
- Measure the impact of your code changes in real-time
- Get alerts before your users notice problems
- Actually sleep at night knowing your systems are visible

This isn't fantasy. This is what OpenTelemetry delivers.

## Are you ready to stop guessing what's happening in your systems?
