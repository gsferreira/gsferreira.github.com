# _"Test-Driven Development changed the way I write code."_

You've heard TDD practitioners say this before, haven't you?

They can't stop talking about benefits like:
* Fewer bugs
* Surprising productivity gains
* Code that's actually maintainable
* A stress-free developer's life
* An almost suspicious level of confidence in their code

Sounds too good to be true?

Yet **few practices earn the "Transformational" label as consistently as TDD does**.

But let's address what you're really wondering: If TDD is so amazing, why isn't everyone doing it?

Simple. **Although TDD is conceptually straightforward, mastering it is hard.**

Don't worry, though. This Workshop will take you there.

**By the end of this Workshop you will:**
* Master the steps of a proper TDD session
* Drive development through tests, not the other way around
* Confidently test-drive code with external dependencies
* Use refactoring techniques to improve code without breaking it
* Create tests that survive codebase evolution
* Be successful with TDD in the context of a Team
* Fearlessly maintain legacy applications using TDD principles
* Leverage AI tools to enhance your TDD workflow

All using C# and tools you already love.

I wouldn't be surprised if you become test-addicted by the end.

**Is this Workshop for you?**

Want better tests and better code? Then yes, this Workshop is for you.

If you've built C# .NET applications and written some unit tests before, you have all the prerequisites needed.

This won't be a passive experience. I believe in learning by doing, so prepare for two days of hands-on work and collaborative problem-solving. Warning: This is not a lecture-type workshopâ€”come ready to participate actively.

**What will you need?**

I strongly believe you should learn using your day-to-day tools. For this Workshop, just bring:
* Your favourite IDE (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
* .NET 9
* Docker (no need for Kubernetes)
* Git
* GitHub.com Account
* Your favourite AI Assistant

**How can you take the Workshop?**
