&lt;p&gt;This is awesome because now we can forget the complex powershell scripts to achieve it. Now we can easily configure fully automated exports to a Storage account and, the best part of it, this is a built-in feature of Windows Azure Management Portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to automate the backup of your database, just go your database and jump to the Configuration Section. In this section, you will see the settings available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gsferreira.com/images/azure-sql-database-automatic-backups-configure-screen.jpg" alt="Azure SQL Database: Automatic Backups - Configure screen" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can configure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The storage account where you want to keep the backup files;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backup frequency;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The retention period;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you'll need to enter the SQL Database login name and password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far as I know, you just pay the storage space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

The tips of this series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize the name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come when called&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie&lt;/li&gt;

Why both? Because they can work perfectly side by side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology? &lt;a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/"&gt;Getting Things Done (GTD) by David Allen&lt;/a&gt;. GTD is about clearing your mind and put everything you need to do in one place first. Collect, process, doing and keep track of it, are the key of GTD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool? &lt;a href="https://trello.com/"&gt;Trello.com&lt;/a&gt;. Do you love Trello? If you don't, probably you didn't give him a try. What is Trello?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a proces"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet that you can find on the web a ton of good articles that explain the beauty of Trello and how GTD can boost your productivity, but that isn't the purpose of this post.
The objective here is to explain you how Trello and GTD can work beautifully side by side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gsferreira.com/images/how-to-implement-getting-things-done-with-trello-funny-productivity.jpg" alt="Productivity funny" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why Trello?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been a Trello user since 2012 so I think that I'm a kind of Trello Ninja. Besides that, I follow the David Allen methodology and I've struggled to put the system rolling until I use Trello to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello is based on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban"&gt;Kanban&lt;/a&gt; method. Kanban it's a way to visualize workflow. Usually a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board"&gt;kanban board&lt;/a&gt; consists in several columns for different phases for a task. Trello also offers you multiple forms of organization like: boards, lists, cards and checklists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;System setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do I take advantage of it to manage my workflow? I've created a Board only for GTD management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waiting On&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gsferreira.com/images/how-to-implement-getting-things-done-with-trello-board.png" alt="Trello board" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have used labels to setup contexts like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Priority (Use the red label for it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appling labels to cards, related to contexts, help me to see only the cards from my current context. You can also use labels only for priority management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Weekly review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mondays morning I look at my Trello "Later" list and move all the tasks into the "This week" or "Today" list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Daily review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the "Inbox" list as capture repository. Process the items in the "Inbox" list daily and move them to the list that you want.
When a task is complete, archive the card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move the cards where I'm expecting someone else to do a task, to the "Waiting On" list so I can keep on top of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have a complex project, I create a specific board for that project. Then, I can create some lists to control the status of each task, like: To Do, Doing, Testing, Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before implementing your own system, read also these great examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How we automate the package build?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's simpler than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Install nuget&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First make sure that you have nuget.exe in your machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is NuGet.exe in your PATH?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a command prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;em&gt;nuget&lt;/em&gt; and hit enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1. If the nuget help documentation is displayed, then nuget.exe is already in your PATH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. If you received the message, "'nuget' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." then nuget.exe is not in your PATH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to add NuGet.exe to your PATH?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a command prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the following command: &lt;em&gt;set PATH=%PATH%;C:\nuget&lt;/em&gt; where "c:\nuget" is the path to the nuget.exe (&lt;a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget#Installing_a_CI_build"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Create the NuGet definition file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the following XML file with the definition for the package with the &lt;em&gt;".nuspec"&lt;/em&gt; extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0"?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;metadata&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;!--
        ID used to identify the nuget package
        --&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;metro-bootstrap&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;!--
        Package version - leave this blank
        --&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;0.0.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;!-- Author, Owner and Licensing details --&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;authors&amp;gt;TalksLab&amp;lt;/authors&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;owners&amp;gt;TalksLab&amp;lt;/owners&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;requireLicenseAcceptance&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/requireLicenseAcceptance&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;copyright&amp;gt;Copyright 2014&amp;lt;/copyright&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;!-- General Information --&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;description&amp;gt;metro-bootstrap: Twitter Bootstrap with Metro style&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;releaseNotes&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/releaseNotes&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;tags&amp;gt;twitter bootstrap css metro responsive html5 talkslab&amp;lt;/tags&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;!-- 
        Packages (incl. minimum version) on which this package
        depends 
        --&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;dependency id="Twitter.Bootstrap.Less" version="3.2.0.1" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/dependencies&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/metadata&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;files&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;file src="app\less\*" target="content\Content\metro-bootstrap" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;file src="dist\css\metro-bootstrap.css" target="content\Content" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;file src="dist\css\metro-bootstrap.min.css" target="content\Content" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/files&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/package&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define in the files element the files to copy to the package.
If you want to test the nuspec file, just type the following command in the command line (where mypackage.nuspec is the name of the nuspec file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nuget pack mypackage.nuspec
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Create grunt task to build the NuGet package&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create the file, go to the grunt script and add the following task (just rename the definition file name):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grunt.registerTask('nuget', 'Create a nuget package', function() {
    var done = this.async();
    //invoke nuget.exe
    grunt.util.spawn({
        cmd: "nuget.exe",
        args: [
            //definition file
            "pack",
            "metro-bootstrap.nuspec",

            //path where the package should be created
            "-OutputDirectory",
            "nuget",

            //override the version using the version in package.json
            "-Version",
            grunt.config.get("pkg").version
        ]
    }, function (error, result) {
        if (error) {
            grunt.log.error(error);
        } else {
            grunt.log.write(result);
        }
        done();
    });
  });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, just open the command line and run the &lt;em&gt;"grunt nuget"&lt;/em&gt; command, and a nuget package will be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration used in this post is running on &lt;a href="https://github.com/TalksLab/metro-bootstrap"&gt;metro-bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; library. Fill free to fork it and try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you.&lt;/p&gt;
