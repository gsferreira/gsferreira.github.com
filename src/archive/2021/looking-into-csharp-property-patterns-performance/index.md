title: Looking into C# Property Patterns Performance
description: How performant are C# Property Patterns?

Property Patterns is one of those things that rapidly changed how I write code. I love how the code looks clear and expressive (see what I've written about it [here](https://gsferreira.com/archive/2021/expressive-c-code-with-property-patterns/)).

In that spirit, I recently tweeted and posted to LinkedIn how I loved simple things like implementing a Guard Clause on collections. See the tweet below.

_[(here)](https://twitter.com/gsferreira/status/1486625607895109635)_

I was aware that this is not for the taste of everyone, and obviously, most comments were from people that prefer other conventional ways of expressing it.

One of the comments was the usual when you post .NET related content: _"What about performance?"_

## Performance ðŸš€

So, I decided to go on a journey to understand how performant Guard clauses with Property Patterns can be.

To do that, I decided to compare the multiple suggestions received with my loved Property Patterns.

So, the candidates were:

### Option A

```csharp
if (list is null || !list.Any())
    return false;
return true;
```

### Option B

```csharp
if (list?.Any() == false)
    return false;
return true;
```

### Option C

```csharp
if (list == null || list.Length == 0)
    return false;
return true;
```

### Option D

```csharp
if (list is not { Length: > 0 })
    return false;
return true;
```

### Option E

```csharp
if (list is null or { Length: 0 })
    return false;
return true;
```

After running a benchmark, I got the following results.

| Method                         | list      |       Mean |     Error |    StdDev |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ---------: | --------: | --------: |
| OptionA_WithoutPropertyPattern | ?         |  0.4362 ns | 0.0262 ns | 0.0232 ns |
| OptionB_WithoutPropertyPattern | ?         |  0.2499 ns | 0.0102 ns | 0.0091 ns |
| OptionC_WithoutPropertyPattern | ?         |  0.2441 ns | 0.0096 ns | 0.0085 ns |
| OptionD_WithPropertyPattern    | ?         |  0.2360 ns | 0.0129 ns | 0.0114 ns |
| OptionE_WithPropertyPattern    | ?         |  0.2630 ns | 0.0332 ns | 0.0432 ns |
| OptionA_WithoutPropertyPattern | String[0] | 15.9249 ns | 0.1260 ns | 0.1117 ns |
| OptionB_WithoutPropertyPattern | String[0] | 15.8818 ns | 0.0796 ns | 0.0706 ns |
| OptionC_WithoutPropertyPattern | String[0] |  0.0475 ns | 0.0165 ns | 0.0146 ns |
| OptionD_WithPropertyPattern    | String[0] |  0.3349 ns | 0.0090 ns | 0.0084 ns |
| OptionE_WithPropertyPattern    | String[0] |  0.3348 ns | 0.0068 ns | 0.0053 ns |
| OptionA_WithoutPropertyPattern | String[1] | 16.1922 ns | 0.0814 ns | 0.0680 ns |
| OptionB_WithoutPropertyPattern | String[1] | 16.2841 ns | 0.1425 ns | 0.1333 ns |
| OptionC_WithoutPropertyPattern | String[1] |  0.4862 ns | 0.0363 ns | 0.0432 ns |
| OptionD_WithPropertyPattern    | String[1] |  0.7454 ns | 0.0616 ns | 0.1817 ns |
| OptionE_WithPropertyPattern    | String[1] |  0.3507 ns | 0.1099 ns | 0.3242 ns |

That was an excellent result.

## How can they do that? ðŸ¤”

As you can see, Property Patterns aren't the most performant, but they are close enough. How?

If you pick option D or E and lower it using [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/), you will see that the Property Patterns lowered version is quite close to Option C, the most performant option.

## So what? ðŸ™„

Now what? Why should I use Property Patterns when there's a most efficient option?

That is true. On the other hand, Property Patterns are expressive (my opinion), but also **they guide you to better decisions**.

As an example, you can't use LINQ with Property Patterns. You can see from benchmark results that it is a good constraint to have. Anything that can set you on the path of success is a good thing to do.

After this journey, this is just one more reason to keep using it. I know it may feel strange for an experienced .NET developer, but give it a try.
