Hi! My name is Guilherme Ferreira. I'm a [Portuguese](https://www.pinterest.com/igori/portugal/) software developer, mostly connected to the web development and to the .net Framework, living in the beautiful city of [Porto](https://www.pinterest.com/turismportugal/porto-portugal/). Go check the pictures, I will be right here waiting for you.

I'm starting this blog with the intent to share the lessons that I learn,
write news about my work and to improve my English writing skills.

Following this page you can expect to read cool stuff about software development, entrepreneurship, productivity tips and other living stuff.
