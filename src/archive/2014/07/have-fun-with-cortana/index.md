title: Have fun with Cortana
category: Windows Phone
---

Have you heard about Cortana? If you are a proud owner of a Windows Phone, I bet you did.

To the others, Cortana is like Siri, but for Windows Phone. One of the few things where iPhone was the first, since Windows Phone release (if you are an Apple fan, I bet that you want to leave your opinion, scroll down and leave a comment, but remember that this is just my humble opinion &#9786; ).

If you have a Windows Phone with 8.1 installed you can start using Cortana. I have been testing and I found some funny questions and another more useful.

I leave a cool list below.

##Funny commands

- Tell me a joke.
- Sing me a song.
- Tell me a story.
- What does the fox say?
- Knock knock.
- Why did the chicken cross the road?
- Say something funny.
- Where do babies come from?
- What is the meaning of life?
- Guess what?
- Do you like Siri?
- What are you wearing?
- May the force be with you.
- Cortana, I'm your father.
- Which is better: Linux or Windows?
- Are you drunk?
- Can you cook?
- Fu\*k you.
- Cortana.
- Talk dirty.

##Useful commands

- Call Peter.
- Text Peter.
- Add appointment to calendar tomorrow.
- What do I have next?
- Remind me to call Peter tomorrow.
- Note: Get eggs.
- Wake me up at 8 AM.

Enjoy and have fun!
