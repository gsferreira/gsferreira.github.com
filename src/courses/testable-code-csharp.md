# Write C# Code With Testing in Mind

If you're stuck in an endless loop of:
- Writing code
- Realising it's impossible to test
- Refactoring everything from scratch

...then I've got news for you: there's a better way.

## The Hidden Cost of Untestable Code

Most C# developers don't realise that every untestable line of code they write creates a time bomb.

That quick hack you used to meet a deadline? The tightly-coupled class that "just works"? The static method calls scattered throughout your codebase?

They're all silently draining your productivity, killing your confidence, and making every future change a nightmare waiting to happen.

## This Course is your escape plan

I'll show you exactly how to write C# code that:

* **Actually wants to be tested** - No more wrestling with your own code
* **Makes bugs obvious** - Before they make it to production
* **Stays maintainable for years** - Even when the original developers are long gone

In just 4 hours, you'll master the techniques that took me 15 years of painful trial-and-error to discover.

## What makes this different from other Testing Courses?

This isn't about testing theory or academic patterns. This is about writing real-world C# code that you can actually test without wanting to pull your hair out.

You'll learn:

* How to design code with explicit behaviours that practically test themselves
* The art of creating narrow responsibilities that make unit tests easy
* Bulletproof techniques for isolating stubborn dependencies
* Simple ways to minimise side effects that sabotage your tests

## Real solutions for real code

We'll tackle the stuff that actually matters in your day-to-day work:

* Making ASP.NET Core controllers that don't fight your test suite
* Designing Entity Framework code you can test without a database
* Creating time-dependent code that doesn't need time travel to test
* Building authentication and authorisation that's actually verifiable

By the end, you'll instinctively know how to write testable code from the start – saving you countless hours of frustration and rewrites.
