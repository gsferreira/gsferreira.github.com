      title: "How to fall in love with TDD",
      description: `Have you tried Test-Driven Development (TDD)? Do you think it's not for you? Was it leading to over-testing and unnecessary complexity? Tests became a maintenance burden? Does it slow down the development process? Due to industry misconceptions, all that is normal. 

      I have good news. We can still change that. You can still reach enlightenment and become a TDD lover.
      
      This talk tells you the story of what will happen once you decide to learn TDD. It will go through the challenges you will face in your journey and how to avoid being trapped by them. We'll debunk misconceptions and see an effective method of practising TDD.
      
      If you are open to becoming TDD addicted, this session is for you. You can expect to go home inspired to master the testing craft.
      
      Be prepared to be Test Infected. Beware, there's no cure!`,

      title: "Apache Kafka in 1 hour for C# Developers",
      description: `Are you a Developer curious about Apache Kafka? Have you never had the time to dig into it?

No problem. In this session, we will dig into it. We will go on a journey to unveil how I've built an event-driven system to power my Patreon account using Kafka. We will focus on the parts you need to know to build Event-Driven Applications. Explore the basic concepts and recommendations. And learn about how to use C# and KafkaFlow, an Open Source framework for .NET. 

Even if you know nothing about it, you can expect to go home with the basics to start your Kafka journey.`,

      title: "The Grand Unified Theory of Clean Architecture and Test Pyramid",
      description: `Clean Architecture and Test Pyramid are two important theories of the software world, but how to combine them?

        If you ever dug deeper into any of them, you know that the number of interpretations is exponential, so there’s no “one way to do it”.
        
        This is a highly opinionated talk based on my experience, with an approach to combine them. We will go through an API built with .NET, but the ideas are technology agnostic.
        
        If you have faced those challenges, this session is for you. You can expect to go home with a simple and clear way to address them.`,

      description: `Are you tired of juggling with complexity every single day? Don't you wish for a simple life?

      Technologists tend to have a passion for complexity. But because of that, we tend to overcomplicate when we face a new challenge.
      
      Finding simple solutions doesn't need to be a magic trick. In this Code free session, we will explore the value that Simplicity can bring to your life and how you can apply it in your day-to-day life.
      
      If you live in the software world, this session is for you. You can expect to go home with some handy Simplification tools.`,
