<p>My experience with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> has been awesome so far. My feeling is that I just needed to understand the basic concepts to be productive with React. The problem is that there are a few advanced concepts that I was missing.</p>

<p>Recently, the lack of knowledge manifested itself as performance issues. To fix them I needed to learn in the hard way. So, I'm sharing this here because if I can prevent you from suffering from it, I would be glad.</p>

<p>I observed that the components of my application were rendering too many times, even when I did not need them to re-render. The following 3 recommendations are the main reasons for that to happen.</p>

<p>If you manage or mentor people, you should be doing one-on-one meetings. 
They are one of the most important tools that you have, so, it's important to maximize the result.</p>

<p><strong>One-on-one meetings are an excellent moment for goal setting</strong>. 
We tend to advise for improvement <strong>and it's a good practice to set a goal</strong>.</p>

<p>The problem is that those goals tend to have the same destiny of new year's eve goals and fail miserably (by the way, if your gym goal has made through January you are doing a good job!).</p>

<p>When we do one-on-one meetings we hope to improve people's lives and the difficult part isn't to identify those goals, those improvement opportunities. 
<strong>The difficult part is to help the team to achieve those goals.</strong></p>

<p>Usually, the intentions are good, and everyone is genuinely trying to do their best. 
I don't see these failures as people's fault, because we, as humans, are specialists in failing to achieve goals.</p>

<p>If you have been in this situation, probably you have noticed that goals use to stay in the "To do" state for a long time. 
So the question is: <strong>What can we do to be more effective?</strong></p>

<p>Don't you freeze when you are asked to be creative and think outside the box?</p>

<p>If so, you probably have been in the following places. Rumbling through ideas without consequences. Don't know where to start. Being repetitive. Procrastinating. Those are just a few consequences when we are facing a clean slate.</p>

<p>These leads us to frustration, disappointment and lack of confidence in our creative skills.</p>

<p>Probably you even think: <em>"How the hell could Steve Jobs be so creative? That guy was a genius! He could think outside the box for sure."</em> Well... I don't think so. Let's see why.</p>

<p>How many times have you been in a situation where you can’t understand a small piece of code?</p>

<p>Readability has a huge impact on code maintenance because reading other’s people code (and sometimes even our code) can be challenging. </p>

<p>As developers, <strong>we tend to ignore the UX (user experience) of our code</strong>. Every single line of code that we do, will eventually be used by others. Is important to be sure that we do the best possible job for our teammates and to future self.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard a recording of your voice? You don’t sound like that, am I right?!</p>

<p>Everyone has been in that situation, and that is strange, especially because we spend so much time with us. Even so, we sound like a poor imitation.</p>

<p>When was the last time that a waitress asked about your meal and you were really honest?</p>

<p>Don’t feel ashamed. I’ve definitively been there. Saying that the meal was good when It was dry or too salty for your taste, is more common than we can think.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, being honest when something is wrong isn’t something that we humans tend to feel comfortable about.</p>

<p>Probably you are asking: why the hell should I be honest and risk to advancing into a difficult conversion?! </p>

<p>Because <strong>the worst kind of feedback is fake feedback</strong>.</p>

      <p>Using a Middleware to log Api Requests in ASP.NET Core is a no brainer.</p>

<p>If you have given a try to <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>, probably you want to follow the same technique and you will wish that the experience was the same.</p>

<p>I've faced this challenge, in order to log the requests to my RPC services and I've been looking for a solution where:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can use <a href="https://serilog.net/">Serilog</a> to log the requests</li>
<li>I know all the requests made to my services</li>
<li>I know how long each request takes to respond</li>
<li>I know the response status</li>
<li>I can correlate each log entry using a Correlation ID</li>
</ul>

      <p>If you are moving to .net Core and you want to implement a versioning strategy in your application, now you have an awesome alternative to the good old fellow "AssemblyInfo". </p>

<p>The alternative is the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build"><em>Directory.build.props</em></a> file. If you place these file in the root folder that contains your source code, when MSBuild runs will add to every project the properties defined in the <em>Directory.build.props</em>.</p>

<p>In this post, we will see how to quickly setup a solution with multiple projects and use <em>Directory.build.props</em> with <a href="http://cakebuild.net">Cake</a> to build and increment the version number.</p>

      <p><em>This post is my interpretation of the Container metaphor and how I use it to understand the concepts and explain containers to others.</em></p>

<p>Containers is one of the hot topics in the Software Development world and Docker is the technology that everyone wants to play with.</p>

<p>Thanks to this hype, everyone has at least a brief idea of what a container is. The problem is that we can easily be confused about what containers really are and the advantages of it.</p>

<p>I faced the same problem and, in my case, explore the container metaphor helped me to understand it.</p>

<h2>So, why containers?</h2>
