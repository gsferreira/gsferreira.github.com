# "I need to learn testing, but which framework should I pick?"
Stop overthinking it.  
MSTest, NUnit, xUnit… they all work.  
But when you look at the industry, one framework stands out.  

Look at serious .NET job postings. What do they expect you to know? More often than not—xUnit.

You’re a junior or mid-level developer. You know testing matters for your career. But you’re stuck reading old blog posts and second-guessing every choice.  

Here’s the truth: xUnit is the standard for .NET testing.

## Why xUnit?
- Widely adopted and battle-tested in modern .NET teams  
- First-class CLI templates and tooling support  
- Actively maintained (xUnit v3) with modern features  
- Common across enterprise codebases and job postings  
So why spend time on three frameworks when you can master the one you’ll use most?

## What you’ll actually learn
This course takes you from your first test to professional-grade testing practices used in real teams.  
By the end you’ll be confident in:  
- Writing tests that actually catch bugs (not just add ceremony)  
- Organizing and naming tests so they scale with large codebases  
- Using xUnit assertions effectively (from basics to custom extensions)  
- Building powerful data-driven tests with Theories  
- Managing test lifecycle with fixtures (class, collection, and assembly-level)  
- Controlling test execution with parallelism, ordering, and conditional runs  
- Capturing output and debugging failing tests with the right tools  
- Generating reports and integrating with CI/CD pipelines  
- Extending xUnit with your own attributes and reusable test libraries  

No fluff, no theory for theory’s sake—just the skills that separate juniors from seniors when it comes to testing in .NET.

Why xUnit over MSTest or NUnit?
</summary>
<div class="pb-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
While all three frameworks work well, xUnit has become the de facto standard for modern .NET development. It's actively maintained, has excellent tooling support, and is commonly used in enterprise environments and open-source projects.
