# "My microservices are a black box, and I'm drowning in logs!"

Sound familiar?

I hear this from developers every day.

Your job has gotten WAY more complex. You've gone from simple apps on IIS to juggling distributed systems that span multiple services, clouds, and containers.

And yet your boss expects you to deliver more features, faster, with fewer bugs. Good luck doing that when you can't even trace a request from start to finish!

That's why you need Observability. Or, let's be specific, you need OpenTelemetry.

## Here's the deal with OpenTelemetry

Imagine if you could:

- See exactly how a request travels through your entire system
- Pinpoint that slow database query killing performance
- Measure the impact of your code changes in real-time
- Get alerts before your users notice problems
- Actually sleep at night knowing your systems are visible

This isn't fantasy. This is what OpenTelemetry delivers.

## What you'll learn in this course

I'm going to take you from confused to confident with OpenTelemetry in .NET.

No fluff, no theory-only nonsense. We'll cover:

- The fundamentals of observability
- How to add automatic instrumentation
- Manual instrumentation techniques (for when you need details)
- Setting up traces, metrics and logs that actually make sense
- Using the OpenTelemetry Collector properly
- Advanced techniques like context propagation and sampling

You'll see tons of real code examples you can copy into your projects tomorrow.

By the end, you'll have x-ray vision into your systems. Your colleagues will wonder how you suddenly got so good at debugging production issues.

## Are you ready to stop guessing what's happening in your systems?
