faqs:
  - question: Will TDD slow down my development process?
    answer: This is the most common concern, and the workshop directly addresses it. While there's an initial learning curve, TDD typically increases development speed by reducing debugging time, preventing regressions, and making refactoring safer. You'll see this firsthand during the exercises.
  - question: What if my current codebase doesn't have tests?
    answer: Perfect! The workshop includes a dedicated module on applying TDD principles to legacy code. You'll learn how to gradually introduce tests and use TDD to safely refactor existing applications.
  - question: Do I need to be an expert in unit testing frameworks?
    answer: Not at all. While basic familiarity with unit testing helps, we'll cover everything you need to know about testing frameworks and tools. The focus is on TDD principles and practices, not tool mastery.
  - question: Will this work with my current team and project constraints?
    answer: Absolutely. The workshop emphasizes practical application and includes strategies for introducing TDD in existing teams and projects. We'll discuss how to overcome common organizational challenges and build consensus around TDD adoption.

# _"Test-Driven Development changed the way I write code."_

You've heard TDD practitioners say this before, haven't you?

They can't stop talking about benefits like:
* Fewer bugs
* Surprising productivity gains
* Code that's actually maintainable
* A stress-free developer's life
* An almost suspicious level of confidence in their code

Sounds too good to be true?

Yet **few practices earn the "Transformational" label as consistently as TDD does**.

But let's address what you're really wondering: If TDD is so amazing, why isn't everyone doing it?

Simple. **Although TDD is conceptually straightforward, mastering it is hard.**

Don't worry, though. This Workshop will take you there.

**By the end of this Workshop you will:**
* Master the steps of a proper TDD session
* Drive development through tests, not the other way around
* Confidently test-drive code with external dependencies
* Use refactoring techniques to improve code without breaking it
* Create tests that survive codebase evolution
* Be successful with TDD in the context of a Team
* Fearlessly maintain legacy applications using TDD principles
* Leverage AI tools to enhance your TDD workflow

All using C# and tools you already love.

I wouldn't be surprised if you become test-addicted by the end.

**Is this Workshop for you?**

Want better tests and better code? Then yes, this Workshop is for you.

If you've built C# .NET applications and written some unit tests before, you have all the prerequisites needed.

This won't be a passive experience. I believe in learning by doing, so prepare for two days of hands-on work and collaborative problem-solving. Warning: This is not a lecture-type workshop. Come ready to participate actively.

**What will you need?**

I strongly believe you should learn using your day-to-day tools. For this Workshop, just bring:
* Your favourite IDE (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
* .NET 9
* Docker (no need for Kubernetes)
* Git
* GitHub.com Account
* Your favourite AI Assistant
