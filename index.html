      <p>Code comments are a common topic of love/hate discussions. 
It's particularly interesting to see developers shifting opinion while experience grows.</p>

<p>Code Comments are a good idea because we are writing them down to help others. Even to help the future self.
But we use a lot of comments that don't help. This explains the Comments bad reputation nowadays.</p>

<p>So, what can we do to improve our comments?</p>

      <p>Have you ever noticed that a successful restaurant has a shorter menu? Especially when compared to those who are struggling.</p>

<p>Why?! <strong>Simplicity!</strong> </p>

<p>When you keep things simple, you focus on fewer things. You give your best and you can focus your effort. You can try to improve and perfect all details.</p>

<p>But, when life doesn't work as we expect, we start throwing new dishes into the menu. Expecting to please everyone. </p>

      <p>When writing Unit Tests, you will need to create test data objects for sure. Usually, those objects have tiny differences between different test cases.</p>

<p>There's a pattern that I especially like when I'm doing this is C#. <a href="https://ardalis.com/improve-tests-with-the-builder-pattern-for-test-data">The Builder Pattern</a>.</p>

<p>The builder pattern is an elegant solution to the problem and I really like it. But, is it a simple solution for JavaScript?</p>

      <p>When I start learning to code, I was taught to declare variables at the top of the code. I followed it for a long time before start questioning that absolute truth.</p>

<p>We are writing code for others to read. So, we shouldn't present our characters too early in the story. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/2493-mind-limit-4.html">Our working memory handle a strict number of things at a given time</a>. </p>

      <p>I've spent the past few days trying to fix a memory leak. I was having problems to figure out what was leaking, so I used windbg wishing that it would help me.</p>

<p>I confess that I'm not an experienced user of windbg, so I google how to catch memory issues using windbg. There's a ton of information out there. The problem is that I didn't found a guide on how to do it with a .net core application.</p>

<p>My experience with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> has been awesome so far. My feeling is that I just needed to understand the basic concepts to be productive with React. The problem is that there are a few advanced concepts that I was missing.</p>

<p>Recently, the lack of knowledge manifested itself as performance issues. To fix them I needed to learn in the hard way. So, I'm sharing this here because if I can prevent you from suffering from it, I would be glad.</p>

<p>I observed that the components of my application were rendering too many times, even when I did not need them to re-render. The following 3 recommendations are the main reasons for that to happen.</p>

<p>If you manage or mentor people, you should be doing one-on-one meetings. 
They are one of the most important tools that you have, so, it's important to maximize the result.</p>

<p><strong>One-on-one meetings are an excellent moment for goal setting</strong>. 
We tend to advise for improvement <strong>and it's a good practice to set a goal</strong>.</p>

<p>The problem is that those goals tend to have the same destiny of new year's eve goals and fail miserably (by the way, if your gym goal has made through January you are doing a good job!).</p>

<p>When we do one-on-one meetings we hope to improve people's lives and the difficult part isn't to identify those goals, those improvement opportunities. 
<strong>The difficult part is to help the team to achieve those goals.</strong></p>

<p>Usually, the intentions are good, and everyone is genuinely trying to do their best. 
I don't see these failures as people's fault, because we, as humans, are specialists in failing to achieve goals.</p>

<p>If you have been in this situation, probably you have noticed that goals use to stay in the "To do" state for a long time. 
So the question is: <strong>What can we do to be more effective?</strong></p>

<p>Don't you freeze when you are asked to be creative and think outside the box?</p>

<p>If so, you probably have been in the following places. Rumbling through ideas without consequences. Don't know where to start. Being repetitive. Procrastinating. Those are just a few consequences when we are facing a clean slate.</p>

<p>These leads us to frustration, disappointment and lack of confidence in our creative skills.</p>

<p>Probably you even think: <em>"How the hell could Steve Jobs be so creative? That guy was a genius! He could think outside the box for sure."</em> Well... I don't think so. Let's see why.</p>

<p>How many times have you been in a situation where you can’t understand a small piece of code?</p>

<p>Readability has a huge impact on code maintenance because reading other’s people code (and sometimes even our code) can be challenging. </p>

<p>As developers, <strong>we tend to ignore the UX (user experience) of our code</strong>. Every single line of code that we do, will eventually be used by others. Is important to be sure that we do the best possible job for our teammates and to future self.</p>
