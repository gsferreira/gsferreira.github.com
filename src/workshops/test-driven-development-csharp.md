# _"Test-Driven Development changed the way I write code."_

That's a quote you recognize if you have been around Test-Driven Development (TDD) practitioners.

They like to brag about TDD benefits such as:

- fewer bugs
- productivity gains
- code easier to maintain
- stress-free developer life
- abnormal level of confidence in code

It sounds too good to be true. However, **few practices have the label "Transformational" used as often as TDD**.

If TDD is so good, why is it not widely adopted?

**Even though TDD is a simple concept, it is hard to master.**

But don't worry about that. This workshop will take you there.

**At the end of this workshop you will be able to:**

- Understand the steps involved during a TDD session.
- Drive the development using automated tests.
- Discover improved confidence and increase in development speed by writing tests first!
- Use refactoring techniques to improve code safely.
- Write long-lasting tests resilient to changes.
- Address the challenges of applying TDD in the context of a Team.
- Confidently evolve and maintain legacy applications using TDD.

All using C# and your favourite tools.

While the course is hands-on and interactive, you will also learn the TDD foundations.

### Target audience

This workshop is for a C# Software Developer who wants to set up his skills.
If that's you, as far as you have basic knowledge of C# .NET and Testing, you are ready for this workshop.

You can expect two days of hands-on and collaboration moments.

I risk saying that at the end of this, you might become test-addicted.

### Equipment needed

I'm a strong believer you should learn using your favourite day-to-day tools. So, in this workshop, you only need:

- Your favourite IDE
- .NET 8
- Docker (no need for Kubernetes)
